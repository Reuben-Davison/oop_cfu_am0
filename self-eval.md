# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
I felt like I had some very productive struggles, making sure I tried utilizing as many different resources as possible.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
I didn't take any breaks working through this assignment. It really did just seemed to flow much better than yesterday, and at no point did I feel like a break was needed.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
I feel like as long as I can take notes and have the time to really absorb the information, then I should do fairly well. Having a different quiet workspace has also been very helpful.
